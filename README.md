# Introduction

Even if World of Warcraft is losing subscribers month after month, it still has a strong community. People with a lot of talent when it comes to role-play, fan-fiction and other artistic creations. One big problem is that all these original creations can only live outside of the game as we can't have any impact on the game it self. That's what Total RP 3 Extended will change.

Total RP 3 brought you the best way to customize your characters and companions (pets and mounts). Total RP 3: Extended brings you the best way to create new content in World of Warcraft: campaigns with quests, customized NPCs and dialogues, items, documents (books, signs, contracts ...) and many more!

# Highlights

- Create highly customizable items and share them securely with other people. When you receive an item from someone, the new security level system will warn you about potentially harmful effects and you can authorize them or not. 
- Place items on the ground to get them back later or place them in stashes that other players will be able to find and open.
- Total RP 3: Extended gives you a brand new RP inventory to place items on your character visually. People with Total RP 3: Extend will be able to see the items you are wearing and you can inspect them too.
- Create rich campaigns with multiple quests and steps, customize in game NPCs to fit your needs and create immersive 3D dialogs with multiple choices.
- This is a separated add-on, we don't "force" any Total RP 3 user to use it. That was a reason why Total RP 2 was considered really heavy for casual roleplayers. If you want Total RP 3: Extended, just get it in addition of Total RP 3. But Total RP 3 alone will stay lightweight.
- The interface is clean, pretty and easy to handle.
- We provide different levels of complexity for the editors interfaces (Quick / Normal / Expert). So you will have a simple UI to quickly create simple items, but when you are ready to go to the next level and have the full unchained experience, you can use the tool in "expert mode". All these concepts will bring this addon to the saying "Easy to learn, hard to master".
- The add-on is separated in two sub-add-ons. One contains the inventory management and a roleplay quest log. The other contains all the creation tools to create your items and quests.
