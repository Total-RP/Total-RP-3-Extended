[[Inner objects are objects stored in a parent object.

We should begin with some examples:
|cffff9900
- You want to create a rifle item with bullets item to charge it. Typically the rifle would be the main object, in which the bullet object would be an inner object for the rifle.

- A mail item opening a document. The document would be an inner object for the mail item.

- Creating quests: any item/document/cutscenes you use in a quest could be inner objects for this quest.

|rThe advantages of using inner objects are multiple:
|cff00ff00
- Inner objects data are really stored inside the parent object data. That means they share the same version number, and their data is exchanged in the same time as the parent object data.

- You can freely determine the inner object ID, as it will use the parent object ID as prefix. You just can't have two inner objects having the same ID inside the same parent object.

- Using inner objects brings better performance.

- It's easier to manage and navigate through your objects if they are stored in parent objects. You can really see a parent object as a folder in which you store files.

|rSo it's simple: when you want to create an object, always ask yourself if it wouldn't be better to have it as an inner object for another item or a quest.

Creating items and quests takes time and energy and it's always terrible when you lose all the hard work you have done.

All add-ons in World of Warcraft can store data but there are limitations:

• There is an unknown data size limit for add-on data (depending on the fact that you are running a 32 or 64 bits client, among other things).
• Reaching this limit can wipe all the add-on saved data.
• Kill the process, force-closing the game client (Alt+F4) or crashing can corrupt the add-on saved data.
• Even if you exit the game correctly, there is always a chance that the game doesn't succeed to save the add-on data and corrupt it.

In regards to all of that, we STRONGLY recommend to regularely backup your add-on saved data.

You can find here a tutorial about finding all saved data:
{link*https://totalrp3.info/documentation/how_to/saved_variables*Where is my information stored?}

You can find here a tutorial about syncing your data to a cloud service:
{link*https://totalrp3.info/documentation/how_to/backup_and_sync_profiles*How to backup and synchronize your add-ons settings using a cloud service}

Please understand we will no longer reply to comments or tickets relating to data wipes.
It's not because we don't want to help but because we can't do anything to restore wiped data.

Thank you, and enjoy Total RP 3 Extended!

|cffff9900The only thing you should be careful with is the carry weight of each container.|r

If a container has a maximum weight capacity and you overpass this capacity, it will slowly be damaged over time and could randomly drop items on the ground!]],

|cffff9900It's very important to always have a primary container with free space as it will be the container used when exchanging items with other players.

|cff00ff00When someone uses the inspection feature on you, they will see the markers with the proper character pose!

You can also see all droped items on the map by using the "Scan for my items" button.

You can perform an action by |cff00ff00right-clicking on the quest log button on the TRP3 toolbar|r.
